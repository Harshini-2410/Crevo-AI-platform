# Crevo – AI-Powered Content Intelligence Platform

Crevo is an AI-driven platform designed to help social media creators and digital brands analyze content performance, generate AI-powered content, and plan posts efficiently using a smart weekly calendar.

This project is built as a **hackathon-ready prototype** focusing on clarity, feasibility, and real-world applicability.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Content creators often rely on guesswork to decide what to post, when to post, and what format works best. Existing tools are fragmented—separating analytics, content creation, and scheduling—leading to inefficiency and inconsistency.

## 💡 Solution Overview

Crevo solves this problem by combining:
- Content performance analysis  
- AI-powered content creation  
- Smart content planning  

into a **single unified platform**.

Crevo analyzes past social media performance, converts insights into actionable AI-generated content, and organizes everything into a weekly content calendar.
